# Facial-Expression-Recognization


## Dataset description:
fer2013 is an open-source dataset which is first, created for an ongoing project by Pierre-Luc Carrier and Aaron Courville,
then shared publicly for a Kaggle competition, shortly before ICML 2013. This dataset consists of 35.887 grayscale,
48x48 sized face images with various emotions -7 emotions, all labeled-.


## There are three different models and the weights for the best model have been uploaded.
## We have acheived accuracy of around 58% which is not bad considering that the highest accuracy achieved till now is around 70% and that too
## with the help of transfer learning and pre-trained image classification models such as InceptionV3.


Inception-v3 is a convolutional neural network that is 48 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version
of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. You can use classify to classify new images using the Inception-v3 model.
Also, Inception-v3 is a convolutional neural network that is trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database.

## Hardware used: intel i5-7200u CPU and Nvidia 940MX(2GB DDR3) GPU
